# 04 Web APIs: Personal Blog

This is a blog website.  The first page contains a gold circle with the title "My First Blog" on the left half of the page.  The right half of the page contains the form for the blog entries consisting of username, blog title and blog content.  Once the submit button is hit, the application will transfer to the second page rendering blog posts. The second page has a light/dark mode toggle functionality.  The second page also has a back link to return to the first page.  The footer on the second page lists links giving the user access to my portfolio and email address.
